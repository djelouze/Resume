  abstract = {Image segmentation through deformable models is a method that localizes
	object boundaries. When difficult segmentation context are proposed
	because of noise or a lack of information, the use of prior knowledge
	in the deformation process increases segmentation accuracy. Medical
	imaging is often concerned by these context. Moreover, medical applications
	deal with large amounts of data. Then it is mandatory to use a robust
	and fast processing.
	
	This question lead us to a local regularisation of the deformable
	model. Highly based on the active contour framework, also known as
	\emph{snake}, we propose a new regularization scheme. This is done
	by filtering the displacements at each iteration. The filter is based
	on a smoothing spline kernel whose aim was to approximate a set of
	points rather than interpolating it.
	
	We point out the consistency of the regularization parameter in such
	a method. It deals with a real, positive λ value that tunes the cut-off
	frequency of a low-pass filter. As it is possible to link analytically
	the cut-off frequency and the sampling frequency, one may give a
	metric meaning to this cut-off frequency. Moreover a different λ
	value should be set at each point through a variation of the filter's
	coefficients. It induces a local cut-off frequency and a local regularization.
	
	This new regularization method should be applied to surfaces. The
	main difficulty concerns the connectivity of the surface mesh. It
	has to be 4-valenced everywhere due to the bidimensionnal fashion
	of the filter. Segmentation results are given for such meshes. A
	special process of singular points on spherical mesh is proposed.}

	The regularization level is controlled through a unique parameter
